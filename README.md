## About
This project attempts to make a chat application that will be accessable on multiple platforms:

* Web browser
* Desktop app
* Android app

In this chat app a user will be able to register a new account and log into his account to chat with his contacts that he'll be able to add based on their unique identifiers.

## Current State
Currently the layout of the log in page, the register page and a representation of what the chat screen will look like. Currently there is no JavaScript involved in the application so the pages are mainly static.

# Technologies
## Currently Implementated
1. JavaScript
2. Bootstrap

## To Be Implemented
1. JQuery
2. React.js
3. Android
